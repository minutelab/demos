Spark word counting example
===========================

This example uses pyspark to count word frequencies in War and Peace

Run it by `sparkwc.mlab [-master <master name>]`.
If the spark cluster was generated by `../spark.mlab` it can use the default master name (master.spark).

The resulting top frequencies will appear in the `count` file on your desktop.
