# Zeppelin container

This directory contain a container to run Zeppelin

## Simple running

Run `zeppelin.mlab -hosts <hosts files>` and then point your browser to `http://localhost:8081`.
Where the hosts files is the one generated by the `spark.mlab` script in the cluster example.

Firs time the container is run the spark interpreter need to configured to the spark master: `spark://master-spark:7077`

## More options

### Data persistence

By default the container persist configuration and notebooks in a volume named zeppelin.
It can be controlled using the `-data` parameter. Running it with `-data ""`, empty means no persistence,
running it with `-data VOLUME:othername` will save the data under `othername`.

### Port

By default it exposes the UI at port 8081, because 8080 will be take by spark itself.
It can be controlled with the `-port` parameter
