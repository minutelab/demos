Tomcat example
==============

This example show how a web application can be developed interactively.

The general model is that code is developed locally, the exploded web application
is synchronized with the container and re-loaded automatically by tomcat,
and can be accessed.

Remote debugging can also be used from the local IDE (for example InteliJ)
